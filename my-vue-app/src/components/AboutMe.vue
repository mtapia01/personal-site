  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <div id="main">
    Originally from the Central Valley, I came to UC Merced in 2020 and graduated May 2024 with a degree in Computer Science
    and Engineering. I became very passionate about web development my first year where I had to develop and maintain a website.
    It was here I learned the fundamentals of programming and became invested in improving my skill-set.
